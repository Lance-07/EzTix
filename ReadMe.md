Project: EzTix

About The Project
EzTix is a project that helps businesses track project success. It has three user categories: normal employees, project managers, and administrators. Administrators have full access to database data, while project managers oversee project details. Employees provide work productivity, and this data is calculated in reports.

How the System Works
EzTix users are created by admin users or project managers, who create a new project with necessary details. Regular employees can add work progress and edit data, while project managers check and update task status. The printable report function is only accessible to admin users and project managers. Regular employees can also update the system's status.
